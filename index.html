                <p>When I little, I was rarely seen without my stuffed bear. My mom received him as a shower gift. I named him
                    Franklin. Though he has had several "operations" and has lost most of his hair, I still love him.

                <p>My folks owned an ice cream parlor on the north end of St. Charles Main Street when I was a kid. It was called
                    Sticky Icky and named after me. They sometimes called me Ick or Icky as a shortened form of Eric.</p>
                <p>Some of the other nicknames I've been given over the years... Mooch, Bugsy, Ham, Hammer, Bubba Gump.</p>

                <p>I still have a vivid memory of a nightmare I had when I was 6. R2-D2 was chasing me, but I got away by running
                    up some stairs.

                <p>My first concert was Culture Club in 1984. It was the Colour by Numbers tour. We sat front row and I slept
                    through the opener, The Mistakes.</p>

                <p>In 8th grade, I broke my arm roller skating. I had a green stick fracture of both the radius and ulna of
                    my right arm. Those are my only broken bones. After I healed, I put the quads back on and skated at the
                    rink as often as 2-4 times a week through high school and beyond. I even bought my own skates instead
                    of renting. I still use those skates over 20 years later.</p>

                <p>In high school, I was in inducted to the International Thespian Society. I earned all my points without ever
                    being in the cast. I still enjoy the theatre. My wife and I have had season tickets to the Fox and the
                    Muny for several years.</p>

                <p>When I go to flea markets, I look for old hotel keys/keychains. My favorite one is from a St Louis hotel
                    and is so old the numbered key looks like a skeleton key.</p>

                <p>I went to Las Vegas for the first time on my 21st birthday with my family to attend Pizza Expo and won a
                    thousand coin jackpot at Luxor.</p>
                <p>
                    I went back to Vegas exactly 10 years later for my 31st. This time as part of a roadtrip that included 4 National Parks,
                    5 states, some very good friends, and a rented minivan.

                Between May 2006 and April 2007, I completed 5 half marathons. I got back to it and did another in 2015. I decided that the
                5Ks are more my style and I've done 20 or so over the past few years.

                I think Scrubs is one of the best shows on TV. If you haven't seen it yet, find the episode called "My Musical" (Episode

                I like going to the range and shooting at paper, but I prefer the instant gratification of watching stuff like ice blocks,
                soda bottles, tin cans, and crab apples blow up. I have a variety of handguns and a couple of small rifles.
                I have my concealed carry permit, but have fortunately never been in a situation that would have been helped
                if I had been carrying. I took the class to learn the rules, but the only time I carry is when I'm heading
                to the range.
